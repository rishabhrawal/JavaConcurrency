Parallelism ==> Ability to do multiple things(process problems) simultaneously

Concurrency ==> Concurrency helps parallely executing tasks to communicate while maintaing the consistency of state
It has principles covering execution order of a program and access to shared resource so that multiple threads can work on it.
Thus concept of concurrency is helpful in achieving parallelism.

Concurrent pieces of code can be executed paralley
